hard issues:
  - typo in ClrFunctionArguments: 'Number
  - can do "{ X = Y }" in table initializers, restrict that syntax as its useless.
  - could use better error reporting. "Unexpected error: This value is not a string." isnt really helpful

qol:
  - maybe allow multiple comma-separated initializers for single var statement?
