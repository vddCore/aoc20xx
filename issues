hard issues:
  - typo in ClrFunctionArguments: 'Number
  - could use better error reporting. "Unexpected error: This value is not a string." isnt really helpful
  - ret from inside a loop doesn't exit the function

qol:
  [X] maybe allow multiple comma-separated initializers for single var statement?
